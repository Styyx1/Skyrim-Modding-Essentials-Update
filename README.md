## Introduction
### About Skyrim Modding Essentials.

Skyrim Modding Essentials is a Wabbajack utility list for Skyrim Special Edition, intended to jumpstart a new mod setup with all the required tools and basic mods. As such, it is intended for experienced modders and no support will be provided beyond the contents of the list itself.

The list was made for Skyrim SE 1.6.x, though the Anniversary Edition DLC is not required.

Support is available on the [Aetherius Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9) server.

## Features

Check the complete mod list and load order on Load Order Library.

- A lean, basic setup clocking in at around 3.8GB plus less than 1GB of downloads.
- Latest stable version of Mod Organizer 2 installed with a separate copy of the vanilla game (Stock Game Folder).
- A collection of handy Mod Organizer 2 plugins for various purposes, see the full list here.
- All modding tools you could possibly need are included and pre-configured, see the full list here.
- Skyrim Script Extender with a correctly configured SKSE.ini file and Address Library for SKSE Plugins.
- All the essentials, including but not limited to MCM Helper, SkyUI, and SSE Display Tweaks.
- Clean MO2 setup with documentation for all changes in the Notes and further documentation on the website.
- The foundational collections of tweaks and fixes: SSE Engine Fixes, po3’s Tweaks, Scrambled Bugs.
- Additional fixes that should be relevant for and compatible with any setup with further recommendations.
- Optionally includes full widescreen support with all relevant patches.
- Optionally includes ENB binaries, premade enblocal.ini, and supplementary mods.

SME uses the Stock Game folder system. That means the setup includes a unique copy of your vanilla game, ensuring the setup is completely standalone and whatever you keep in your default installation folder will not affect the setup at all. This is a lifesaver when you keep more than one instance of MO2. Setting up all tools for Stock Game folder can be a little annoying so you’re welcome, it’s all done for you.

## Installation

***
### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing Skyrim Modding Essential, please complete the following steps.
>**If you already installed ANY Skyrim Special Edition modlist with Wabbajack before, none of the Pre-Installation steps are needed anymore**


1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside /Documents/My Games/.
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.

> **Step 3 and 4 are only necessary if you modded the game without 'stock game' and cleaned the master files**

Installing Rare Curios Files

**Warning**

Do NOT skip this step or your install may fail!

From the 1.6.1130 update and onwards, Steam now ships Skyrim with its own version of the free CC files. However these files do not have the same hashes as the files that are downloaded from the in-game Creation Club menu for AE users. In order to work around this issue and make the list as accessible as possible, the list is compiled using the file hashes from the in-game CC downloads.

To download Bethesda's version of Rare Curios:

- Navigate to your Skyrim SE's Steam Data folder
    - i.e. D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\data
- Delete both Rare Curios files:
    - ccbgssse037-curios.bsa
    - ccbgssse037-curios.esl
- Launch Skyrim SE from Steam and select Creations at the main menu
- Select Search at the bottom and search for Rare Curios
- Select the card titled Rare Curios and press Download
- Once it is done, accept Bethesda's load order message and exit the game

after that follow [these instructions](https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/sme/installation/) without the step to set up Skyrim SE
