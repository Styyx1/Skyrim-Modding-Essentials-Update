## Installation

***
### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing Skyrim Modding Essential, please complete the following steps.
>**If you already installed ANY Skyrim Special Edition modlist with Wabbajack before, none of the Pre-Installation steps are needed anymore**


1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside /Documents/My Games/.
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.

> **Step 3 and 4 are only necessary if you modded the game without 'stock game' and cleaned the master files**

Installing Rare Curios Files

**Warning**

Do NOT skip this step or your install may fail!

From the 1.6.1130 update and onwards, Steam now ships Skyrim with its own version of the free CC files. However these files do not have the same hashes as the files that are downloaded from the in-game Creation Club menu for AE users. In order to work around this issue and make the list as accessible as possible, the list is compiled using the file hashes from the in-game CC downloads.

To download Bethesda's version of Rare Curios:

- Navigate to your Skyrim SE's Steam Data folder
    - i.e. D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\data
- Delete both Rare Curios files:
    - ccbgssse037-curios.bsa
    - ccbgssse037-curios.esl
- Launch Skyrim SE from Steam and select Creations at the main menu
- Select Search at the bottom and search for Rare Curios
- Select the card titled Rare Curios and press Download
- Once it is done, accept Bethesda's load order message and exit the game

after that follow [these instructions](https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/sme/installation/) without the step to set up Skyrim SE
